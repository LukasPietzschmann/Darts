# Darts
A small Application to keep track of a game of Darts written in Kotlin

## Disclaimer
This project is my attempt to learn the Kotlin Programming Language.
If you also want to learn Kotlin and for some reason you stumbled upon this Repo, you might not want to use this as a reference, as the code might certainly contain stupid beginner mistakes.
But I'm willing to implement any improvement suggestions :)
